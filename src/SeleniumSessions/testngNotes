TestNG : unit test framework
it is TDD framework :Test drivern Development


purpose: design test cases in systeamtic way
open source,free
available  in form of jar files

Java Unit testing framework

advantages
1. design test cases in systeamtic way
2. good html reports
3. provide diffrrrnt annotation
4, priorities -- priority=5
5. dependency i.e. dependsOnMethods if homepage method is dependent on login method,and 
				login method is failed then homepage method is skipped/ignored
6.	grouping groups="test"
7,	data provider: same test case can be run by n number of tyms with different set of data
8 	invocationCount=10
9 	forinfinite loop (invocationTimeOut = 2)we should avoid these 
10 (expectedExceptions=NumberFormatException.class) === to handle exceptions in TestNG with try catch,similarly for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
11 Assert.assertEquals(title, "Google");
12 : Assert.assertTrue(b1); : for boolean ..true/false
	or we can use Assert.assertEquals(b1, true);
13. testNG.xml file : to run all classes together: known asrunner/template file
14; generate  testNG.xml file automatically : right click on eclipse project > TestNG > Convert to TestNG
we can pass parameter through testNG.xml file  : data driven approach : 
15. advantage of testng xml file :if new teammate cime to project,then he will not go to script .Directly fromtestng.xml file
	he can change his username/passwrd and run the test suite..similarto config.properties file 
16. when we dot want to use data provider/testng.xml then @dataprovider annotation is used.Data is prepared in excel file
17.
